A Simplified Open-Source Prototype for a Dynamic Hash Encryption System

This prototype demonstrates a dynamic hash encryption system that continuously generates random hash codes in real-time.

In this prototype, a unique public key represents the public identity, a unique secret key represents the security token, and a dynamic key represents the real-time timestamp. All three are fed into a cryptographic hash function, with the process repeating once per second, generating hash codes that continuously evolve.
Project Aim

The ultimate goal of this project is to establish an open-source dynamic security verification system that generates continuously changing verification codes, making them challenging to replicate or forge.

This model also stems from contributions to various global innovation challenges, including participation in the Absher Innovation Challenge held in Saudi Arabia in 2024.
